For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips 

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report

# pull description of the crime by filtering out all crimes from crime_scene_report that aren't murders occurring on the date and in SQL City
crime_description <- crime_scene_report |>
  filter(date == "20180115", 
         type == "murder", 
         city == "SQL City") |>
  select(description)
# clue 1: "Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave"."

```

```{r}
#| label: find-witnesses

# find the id of the witnesses
witness_1 <- person |>
  filter(address_street_name == "Franklin Ave", 
         str_detect(name, "Annabel"))
witness_2 <- person |>
  filter(address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr") |> 
  arrange(desc(address_number)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
# clue 2: id to match with interview is 16371 and 14887
witness_interviews <- interview |>
  filter(person_id %in% c("16371", "14887"))
# clue 3: "I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th."
# "I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W"."

```

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-get-fit-now-member

# pull all data from Get Fit Now with gold members with membership number starting with "48Z"
member_suspect <- get_fit_now_member |>
  filter(membership_status == "gold", 
         str_detect(id, "48Z"))
# cross check members 48Z7A and 48Z55 with license plate "H42W"
license_suspect <- drivers_license |>
  filter(gender == "male", 
         str_detect(plate_number, "H42W"))

```

```{r}
#| label: find-suspect

# search person for individual with the license id and person id 
suspect <- person |>
  filter((license_id %in% c("423327", "664760")),
         (id %in% c("28819", "67318")))

#check interview with suspect 67318
suspect_interview <- interview |>
  filter(person_id== "67318")
# clue 5: "I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017."
```


**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!


## And the final suspect is...

*Put the name of the person responsible for the murder here:*
